Kim Schlesinger's 2021 DigitalOcean Kubernetes Challenge 

The challenge I am completing is deploying a security and compliance system using Falco. 

## Done 
- Spun up a DigitalOcean Kubernetes Cluster
- Installed Falco via Helm following these instructions: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/falcosecurity/falco
- Tested that Falco was working by execing into a pod and looking through the logs of a Falco Pod 

## To Do 
- Install FalcoSideKick and wire up alerts to Slack or Discord 
- Configure some custom rules 
- Complete my project writeup and submit a PR to the kubernetes-challenge repo.
